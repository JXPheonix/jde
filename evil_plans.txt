1. Finish the basis (a console able to pass commands to java)
2. Split into two branches, GUI and Console
3. On GUI, rudimentary Swing GUI so console looks spiffier
4. On Console, support for infinite amount of brackets, etc.
5. Merge both into Master, v0.1
6. Make new branch devel (master is only for #'d versions), continue development work there, namely
7. A proper text editor (v0.2)
8. Syntax highlighting (v0.3)
9. "Project" support (v0.4)

Hopes and fears for project end date (for these first nine steps):
Hopes: December 2012
Fears:   July   2013
