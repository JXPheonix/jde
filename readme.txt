JDE

What is JDE?

The one and only Java Development Enviroment, like eclipse and netbeans, only coded 100% in java.

But the git chart thingamiggier says only 95% java!

Shut up.

Is this the official IDE for java?

No. It is in no way endorsed by any of the people who work on java.

Where can I find the source code?

You're looking at it right now, hurr.

Where can I find an installer?

Right now the installers are invisible, because they don't exsist. I hope to have a linux or windows binary out soonish, though.

What is the meaning of life?

Look elsewhere.

How do I compile/build JDE?

Uhm. You can't really do that yet either.

How the heck am I supposed to start it then?

Open up the eclipse workspace (in the folder /eclipse) and run as you would any other project.

This looks ugly.

Shaddup, it's a WIP.

There's, like, no code here at all.

Shaddup, it's a WIP.

Seriously, do you just make git repos and then neglect them?

You're making me cry. Go away.
